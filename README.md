### Hi I'm Dan ðŸ‘‹

I am a data science leader who has successfully delivered consultancy and platform focussed data science products. I am at my best working with customers and other stakeholders, to help define a problem and develop and deliver ML-based solutions to solve that problem. 

My professional experience is focused on the industrial sector, developing and deploying anomaly detection algorithms for use cases such as predictive maintenance or network security. This includes Deep Learning and more traditional machine learning approaches, and cloud and edge based deployments.
