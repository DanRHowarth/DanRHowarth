### Hi I'm Dan ðŸ‘‹

I am a **data science leader** who has successfully delivered **consultancy and platform focussed** data science products. I am at my best working with customers and other stakeholders, to help define a problem and develop and deliver ML-based solutions to solve that problem. 

My professional experience is focused on the industrial sector, developing and deploying **anomaly detection** algorithms for use cases such as **predictive maintenance** or **network security**. This includes **Deep Learning** and more traditional machine learning approaches, and **cloud and edge based deployments**. 

I am a **strong technical communicator** and have taught data science at the **University of Oxford**, and written blogs for **Gantry**, a cutting-edge MLOps-focussed Silicon Valley start-up. 

I work hard to keep my skills relevant: a recent focus has been **MLOps** and state-of-the-art Deep Learning.   

This repo includes the following:

#### MLOps
* An example of a robust, reproducible **ML pipeline** using **Weights and Biases** for experiment tracking
* Deploying ML Models with **CI/CD**, using **FastAPI**, **Github Actions** and **Heroku** 
* Model **Monitoring** and Scoring

#### Deep Learning (and MLOps) 
* Deployment of Image Anonymizer application using **Streamlit**, **Docker** and drawing on state-of-the-art models (the output of a Full Stack Deep Learning project group I was part of, and which was selected as a top project for the 2022 cohort)
* Deployment of Hand Writing Recogniser, with inference performed via **severless GPUs** (this repo represents the teaching material for the Full Stack Deep Learning course, and I then subsequenty contributed to the severless GPU implementation)

#### Teaching 
* A repo containing the notebooks and other teaching material I developed for the **University of Oxford** is here
* And some **tensorflow2** notebooks I developed for a series of workshops are in this repo
* The blogs I have written for Gantry are available [here](https://gantry.io/blog/), covering MLOps, LLMs and other topics
